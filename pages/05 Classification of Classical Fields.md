# 05 — Classification of Classical Fields

This page applies the axioms and admissibility criteria established in the preceding sections to
the major classes of classical fields.

The classification is **eliminative**. Candidate field classes are examined solely with respect to
closure, exhaustion under symmetry, and absence of external bookkeeping. No appeal is made to
phenomenology, quantisation, or historical status.

## Scope of the classification

Only **classical interaction fields** are considered.

Matter fields, kinematic fields, and effective descriptions are discussed only insofar as they are
sometimes proposed—explicitly or implicitly—as fundamental interaction fields.

The question addressed is narrow and precise:

> Which classical interaction fields are admissible in principle under closure?

## Taxonomy of classical fields

For the purposes of classification, classical fields fall into four broad categories:

1. Gauge-type interaction fields  
2. Matter-type fields  
3. Composite or effective media  
4. Self-coupled universal interaction fields  

Each category is examined in turn.

## Gauge-type interaction fields

Gauge-type interaction fields are characterised by:

- conserved quantities associated with gauge symmetries;
- charges supplied by independent matter sectors;
- field equations whose source terms are not determined internally.

### Closure analysis

Gauge fields fail closure in the sense defined in the FFT.

Their conserved quantities depend explicitly on independent charge sectors that are not dynamically
fixed by the gauge field itself. Conservation is therefore not self-contained.

Even in highly symmetric settings, gauge theories retain residual functional freedom unless external
charge distributions are specified. This violates exhaustion under symmetry.

### Classification result

Gauge-type interaction fields are **open** under the FFT criteria.

This does not undermine their empirical success or internal consistency. It excludes only their
qualification as self-closing fundamental interaction fields.

---

## Matter-type fields

Matter fields supply dynamical content but do not mediate universal interactions.

Examples include scalar, spinor, or fluid fields whose equations of motion depend on background
geometric or interaction structures.

### Closure analysis

Matter fields cannot close because:

- their conserved quantities depend on external interaction fields;
- they do not regulate conservation universally;
- they do not exhaust under symmetry independently.

### Classification result

Matter fields are excluded from fundamentality **as interaction fields**.

They may be fundamental in other senses, but they cannot serve as closing interaction fields under
the present framework.

---

## Composite and effective media

Composite or effective descriptions include:

- hydrodynamic fields;
- elastic media;
- coarse-grained or emergent descriptions;
- phenomenological modifications with scale-dependent rules.

### Closure analysis

Such fields explicitly rely on truncation, averaging, or regime-dependent prescriptions.

Residual functional freedom persists even under strong symmetry, and conservation depends on
external modelling choices.

### Classification result

Composite and effective media are **structurally open** and therefore inadmissible as fundamental
interaction fields.

---

## Self-coupled universal interaction fields

A final class consists of interaction fields that are:

- universally coupled;
- self-interacting;
- not sourced by independent charge sectors;
- capable, in principle, of regulating their own conserved quantities.

This class is narrow by construction.

### Closure analysis

Only fields in this class can plausibly satisfy:

- self-contained conservation;
- exhaustion under symmetry;
- absence of external bookkeeping.

Within classical physics, these requirements force geometric mediation and universal coupling.

---

## Interim conclusion

The eliminative classification yields a single admissible class of classical interaction fields:

> **Self-coupled, universal, geometrically mediated interaction fields.**

All other classes fail closure or exhaustion under symmetry.

The next page shows that, in the classical domain, this class uniquely identifies gravity.
