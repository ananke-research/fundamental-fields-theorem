# 07 — Domain of Validity and Falsification

This page states the **Fundamental Fields Theorem** explicitly, clarifies its logical status, and
delimits precisely where the result applies and how it can fail.

The aim is to prevent overextension and to make the theorem **falsifiable at the structural level**.

## Statement of the Fundamental Fields Theorem

**Fundamental Fields Theorem (FFT).**  
Under the requirements of classical covariance and self-contained conservation in closure regimes,
any admissible fundamental classical interaction field must be universal, self-coupled, and
geometrically mediated.  
In the classical domain, this uniquely identifies gravity as the only interaction field capable of
closure.

All other classical interaction fields are necessarily open in the stated sense, relying on external
charge sectors, phenomenological prescriptions, or residual functional freedom.

## Logical status of the theorem

The FFT is a **classification theorem**, not a dynamical model.

It does not propose new equations of motion, modify existing theories, or introduce new physical
entities. Its conclusions follow deductively from:

- explicit definitions of fundamentality and closure;
- minimal axioms already implicit in physics practice;
- eliminative reasoning applied uniformly across field classes.

The theorem is conditional: rejecting its conclusion requires rejecting at least one of its premises.

---

## Domain of validity

The FFT applies under the following conditions:

- classical interaction fields;
- regimes admitting covariantly defined conserved quantities;
- claims of fundamentality understood as law-completeness and closure.

Within this domain, the classification is exhaustive.

Outside this domain, the theorem makes **no claims**.

## What would falsify the theorem

The FFT would be falsified if **any one** of the following were demonstrated:

1. A classical interaction field other than gravity that admits self-contained conserved quantities
   without independent charge sectors.
2. A non-gravitational interaction field that exhausts all functional freedom under sufficient
   symmetry without external prescriptions.
3. A consistent classical interaction field that is universal, self-coupled, and non-geometric.
4. A closed interaction field whose conserved quantities require no geometric mediation.

Absent such a counterexample, the classification stands.

---

## What does *not* falsify the theorem

The FFT is **not** falsified by:

- empirical success of open or effective theories;
- existence of dark matter or dark energy as phenomenological constructs;
- breakdown of conservation in non-closure regimes;
- quantum anomalies or ultraviolet incompleteness;
- modified gravity models that introduce additional fields or prescriptions.

These lie outside the theorem’s scope.

## Relation to General Relativity

The FFT does not re-derive General Relativity, nor does it privilege any specific gravitational
action.

It explains, at a structural level, why gravity alone exhibits:

- rigidity in vacuum;
- exhaustion under symmetry;
- exactness in its clean regimes.

General Relativity appears downstream as one realisation of a closed classical gravitational field,
not as an axiom.

## Relation to the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem

The FFT answers the question:

> **Which interaction field can close?**

The downstream **Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem** answers a different question:

> **Given that gravity must close, what internal response structure and action are admissible?**

The FFT does not assume Ananke, and Ananke does not re-prove FFT.
Their logical separation is essential.

## Final summary

The Fundamental Fields Theorem formalises a distinction long present but rarely stated in classical
physics.

By making closure explicit and applying it uniformly, the theorem shows that gravity’s exceptional
status is not accidental or historical. It is structural.

Gravity is not assumed to be fundamental.  
It is the only classical interaction field that can be.
