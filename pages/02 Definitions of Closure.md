# 02 — Definition of Closure

This page fixes the core definitions used throughout the Fundamental Fields Theorem (FFT).
All subsequent results are **conditional** on these definitions. Any objection to the theorem
must therefore reject one or more of them explicitly.

The purpose of this page is precision, not interpretation.

## Classical fields and theories

A **classical field** is a set of tensorial or geometric quantities defined on a smooth spacetime
manifold, governed by covariant field equations derivable from a variational principle or an
equivalent local dynamical law.

No assumptions are made regarding quantisation, ultraviolet completion, or microscopic ontology.
The FFT applies strictly within the classical domain.

## Fundamental classical interaction fields

A classical field is said to be **fundamental** (in the sense relevant here) if, within its declared
classical domain of validity:

1. its field equations are **law-complete**, requiring no regime-dependent prescriptions,
   interpolations, or external supplements;
2. it is not defined as an effective or emergent description of more primitive degrees of freedom;
3. it applies **universally** within its scope, without modification of its defining equations
   across physical regimes.

This definition is **conditional**. The FFT does not assert that all fields are fundamental;
it classifies fields *claiming* fundamentality under these criteria.

---

## Classical covariance

A field theory is **classically covariant** if its equations of motion, constraints, and conserved
quantities are invariant under the appropriate spacetime symmetry group (diffeomorphisms in the
relativistic domain), with no fixed background structures.

This excludes preferred frames, background metrics, or coordinate-dependent definitions of
physical quantities.

Classical covariance is treated as a minimal prerequisite for any universal interaction field.

---

## Closure regimes

A **closure regime** is a class of spacetime domains in which covariantly defined conserved
quantities are standardly recognised in established physics.

Examples include:

- stationary or static spacetimes (Komar-type charges),
- asymptotically flat spacetimes (ADM or Bondi charges),
- symmetry-reduced sectors admitting Noether charges.

Closure is evaluated **only** in such regimes. No claim is made that conserved quantities exist
in all conceivable spacetimes.

---

## Self-contained conserved functionals (closure)

A classical interaction field admits **closure** if, in every closure regime, there exists a
covariantly defined conserved functional, denoted 𝒬[Ψ], constructed solely from the field itself
and the geometric structures it dynamically determines, such that:

1. 𝒬[Ψ] is finite on all admissible configurations;
2. conservation of 𝒬[Ψ] follows from the field equations alone;
3. no external sectors, regulators, hidden variables, or regime-dependent rules are required
   to define or preserve 𝒬[Ψ].

Closure is an **internal property** of an interaction field. Declaring “the universe as a whole”
to be closed does not constitute closure of a specific interaction field.

---

## Closed versus open fields

A field is **closed** if it admits a self-contained conserved functional in all closure regimes.

A field is **open** if its conserved quantities depend on independent external sectors,
phenomenological prescriptions, residual functional freedom, or bookkeeping not fixed by the
field equations themselves.

Openness does not imply empirical failure. It precludes only claims of self-closing fundamentality.

---

## External bookkeeping

**External bookkeeping** denotes any prescription required to maintain consistency or conservation
that is not dynamically determined by the field equations themselves, including:

- independent conserved charge sectors;
- interpolation or screening functions;
- regulator-dependent counterterms;
- environment- or scale-dependent rule changes.

Any interaction field requiring such bookkeeping cannot qualify as fundamental under the present
definitions.

---

## Exhaustion under symmetry

A closed interaction field is said to **exhaust under symmetry** if, when sufficient spacetime
symmetry is imposed within a closure regime, all functional freedom in admissible solutions is
eliminated.

Only a finite set of integration constants—fixed by conservation laws and boundary conditions—
may remain.

Failure of exhaustion indicates the persistence of hidden functional freedom and therefore implicit
external bookkeeping.

Exhaustion under symmetry is treated as an **admissibility criterion derived from closure**, not
as an independent axiom.

---

## Interaction fields versus matter fields

An **interaction field** mediates relations between other degrees of freedom and organises their
dynamics universally.

A **matter field** supplies content or sources but does not, by itself, mediate a universal
interaction.

The FFT classifies **interaction fields only**. Matter fields may be fundamental in other senses,
but they cannot serve as closing interaction fields under the criteria adopted here.

---

## Response modes (for later use)

A **response mode** of a field is an independent way in which the field reacts to sources or
boundary conditions, contributing additively to the conserved functional 𝒬[Ψ].

Response modes are counted by independent contributions to 𝒬[Ψ], not by field components or
gauge artefacts.

The notion of orthogonality of response modes is recorded here for completeness; it enters
explicitly only in the downstream Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem.

---

## Scope statement

All results of the FFT apply to classical interaction fields in closure regimes admitting
covariantly defined conserved quantities.

No claims are made regarding:

- quantum completion or ultraviolet behaviour;
- regimes in which conservation laws are ill-defined;
- microscopic ontology of matter fields.

---

## Summary

The FFT rests on the following minimal commitments:

- classical covariance;
- self-contained conserved quantities in closure regimes;
- exclusion of external bookkeeping;
- exhaustion under symmetry as an admissibility criterion;
- restriction to interaction fields.

These definitions fix the logical space in which the classification is carried out.
All subsequent results follow deductively from them.
