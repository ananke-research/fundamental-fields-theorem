## The Fundamental Fields Theorem (FFT)

The **Fundamental Fields Theorem (FFT)** is an upstream structural classification result.
It addresses a logically prior question to model building, phenomenology, or action selection:

**Which classical interaction fields can be fundamental in principle?**

Rather than asking how a given field behaves dynamically, the theorem asks whether a classical interaction field is *structurally capable* of standing alone as a fundamental interaction—without external bookkeeping, regime-dependent prescriptions, or auxiliary sectors.

## The classification problem

Modern theoretical physics provides powerful frameworks for constructing and analysing field theories once the field content is assumed. Representation theory classifies particle states, gauge principles organise interactions, and variational methods constrain admissible actions.

What is largely absent is a clear upstream answer to a more basic question:

> If a classical interaction field is claimed to be fundamental, what minimal structural requirements must it satisfy?

As a result, gravity, gauge fields, and effective descriptions are often discussed on equal footing, despite exhibiting radically different structural behaviour in their clean symmetry regimes.

The FFT addresses this upstream gap directly.

## Structural, not phenomenological

The FFT is **not** a phenomenological analysis. It does not ask:

- which theories fit data best,
- which models are most economical,
- or which interactions quantise most cleanly.

Instead, it performs a **structural classification**.  
It asks which classical interaction fields are *admissible in principle* once conservative criteria for fundamentality are made explicit.

Empirical adequacy is not the issue here. Admissibility is.

## The central idea: closure

The organising concept of the FFT is **closure**.

In regimes where conserved quantities are well defined in established physics, a fundamental interaction field should:

- regulate its own conservation laws,
- exhaust its degrees of freedom under sufficient symmetry,
- and require no external bookkeeping to remain consistent.

These requirements are already applied tacitly in physics practice.  
The FFT makes them explicit and uses them deductively.

## What the FFT establishes

Under minimal upstream requirements—classical covariance and self-contained conservation—the FFT proves the following conditional result:

> Any admissible fundamental classical interaction field must be universal, self-coupled, and geometrically mediated.

In the classical domain, this uniquely identifies **gravity** as the only interaction field capable of closure.

All non-gravitational interaction fields are necessarily **open** in the stated sense: their conserved quantities depend on independent charge sectors, external prescriptions, or residual functional freedom.

## What the FFT does *not* do

For clarity, the FFT does **not**:

- propose a new gravitational model,
- modify General Relativity,
- assume a specific action or field content,
- address quantum gravity or ultraviolet completion,
- introduce dark matter or dark energy claims,
- or derive phenomenological scaling laws.

Those questions arise *downstream* and are treated elsewhere.

## Logical position in the framework

The FFT sits upstream of the **Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem**.

- **FFT** answers: *Which interaction field can close?*
- **Ananke** answers: *Given that gravity must close, what internal response structure is admissible?*

This separation is essential. The FFT isolates gravity structurally; it does not complete it.

## How to read this repository

This repository mirrors the logical structure of the FFT paper:

- Definitions and scope are fixed before any classification.
- Axioms are minimal and explicitly stated.
- Admissibility criteria are derived, not assumed.
- Candidate field classes are eliminated by necessity.
- The theorem follows by exhaustion, not by preference.
