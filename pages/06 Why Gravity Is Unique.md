# 06 — Why Gravity Is Unique

This page completes the eliminative classification by showing that, within classical physics,
the admissible class identified previously is realised **uniquely** by gravity.

No appeal is made to phenomenology, historical precedent, or preference. The result follows from
structural necessity.

## The admissible class revisited

The preceding classification isolated a single admissible class of classical interaction fields:

- universal in scope;
- self-coupled;
- free of independent charge sectors;
- capable of self-contained conservation;
- exhausting under sufficient symmetry;
- geometrically mediated.

The question now is whether this class is populated by more than one classical interaction field.

## Universality forces geometric mediation

A universal interaction must couple to all forms of energy and momentum without exception.

In classical physics, this requirement has a decisive consequence: the interaction cannot be defined
on a fixed background structure. It must instead determine, or be identified with, the geometric
structure on which all fields propagate.

Any interaction field that presupposes a fixed spacetime background fails universality at the
structural level, regardless of how broadly it couples.

Thus, universality forces **geometric mediation**.

## Self-coupling excludes external charge sectors

A self-coupled interaction field must act as both source and mediator of its own influence.

This excludes:

- interactions sourced by independently conserved charges;
- fields whose conserved quantities are fixed by external sectors;
- theories in which coupling strengths or charges must be specified independently of the field.

Only an interaction whose “charge” is inseparable from the total field configuration itself can
satisfy this requirement.

In classical physics, this criterion is met only when the interaction couples to the total
stress–energy content, including its own contribution.

## Exhaustion under symmetry and rigidity

A self-coupled, geometrically mediated interaction field must exhaust all functional freedom under
sufficient symmetry.

In particular, in highly symmetric closure regimes:

- no arbitrary functions may survive;
- conserved quantities must be fixed by boundary conditions;
- exterior solutions must be rigid and unique.

This rigidity is not an added assumption. It is the structural consequence of closure combined with
universality and self-coupling.

## Identification with gravity

Within classical physics, there exists exactly one interaction field that satisfies all of the above
requirements:

- it couples universally to energy–momentum;
- it is inseparable from spacetime geometry;
- it is self-interacting;
- it admits self-contained conserved quantities;
- it exhausts under symmetry and exhibits rigidity in its clean regimes.

This interaction field is **gravity**.

The conclusion is not that gravity has been assumed to be fundamental, but that it is **forced to
be** once closure and admissibility are imposed.

---

## Uniqueness

No other classical interaction field shares this combination of properties.

Gauge interactions fail universality and self-contained conservation.
Matter fields fail mediation.
Composite and effective descriptions fail closure by construction.

The admissible class therefore contains **exactly one element** in the classical domain.

## Transition to the theorem

The eliminative classification is now complete.

The next page states the **Fundamental Fields Theorem** explicitly and clarifies its domain of
validity, logical status, and relation to the downstream Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem.
