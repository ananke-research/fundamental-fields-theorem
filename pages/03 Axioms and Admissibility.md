# 03 — Axioms and Admissibility

This page states the **minimal upstream axioms** required for the Fundamental Fields Theorem (FFT)
and distinguishes clearly between **axioms** and **derived admissibility criteria**.

The guiding principle is minimality: no assumption is introduced unless it is unavoidable for a
field claiming fundamentality.

---

## Upstream axioms

### Axiom A — Classical covariance

Any candidate fundamental interaction field must admit a **classically covariant formulation**.

That is, its field equations, constraints, and conserved quantities must be invariant under the
appropriate spacetime symmetry group (diffeomorphisms in the relativistic domain), with no fixed
background structures.

This axiom is not specific to gravity. It is a prerequisite for any theory purporting to describe a
universal interaction in classical physics.

Rejecting Axiom A amounts to endorsing preferred frames or background-dependent laws at the
fundamental level, a position outside the scope of the present framework.

---

### Axiom B — Self-contained conservation (closure)

Any candidate fundamental interaction field must admit **self-contained conservation** in every
closure regime.

Equivalently, the existence and conservation of the field’s conserved quantities must follow from
the field equations alone, without reliance on:

- independent external sectors,
- phenomenological prescriptions,
- interpolation or screening mechanisms,
- or regime-dependent rules.

Axiom B encodes the requirement of **law-completeness** for a fundamental interaction field.

This axiom is explicitly scoped: it does not demand conservation where no conserved quantities are
defined in established physics.

---

## Minimality of the axioms

Axioms A and B are **irreducible** in the following sense:

- Classical covariance (Axiom A) cannot be derived from self-contained conservation, since
  conservation presupposes transformation properties.
- Self-contained conservation (Axiom B) cannot be derived from covariance alone, since covariance
  does not enforce law-completeness.

No additional upstream axioms are imposed.

In particular, no assumptions are made regarding:

- the number of field components;
- the form of the action;
- the order of the field equations;
- the presence or absence of gauge symmetry;
- the existence of a vacuum sector;
- universality of coupling.

All further restrictions enter only as **admissibility criteria** derived from Axioms A and B.

## Derived admissibility criteria

### Criterion C — Exhaustion under symmetry

A candidate interaction field satisfying Axioms A and B must **exhaust its degrees of freedom under
sufficient spacetime symmetry** in any closure regime.

When symmetry conditions are imposed—such as stationarity, homogeneity, isotropy, or spherical
symmetry—the admissible solution space must collapse to a finite-dimensional family parameterised
solely by integration constants fixed by conservation laws and boundary conditions.

Logical status:  
Criterion C is **not an independent axiom**. It follows directly from Axiom B. If residual functional
freedom remains under symmetry, then admissible solutions are not determined by the field equations
alone, and external choices are required. Such freedom constitutes implicit external bookkeeping and
violates closure.

---

### Criterion D — No external sourcing of structure

A candidate fundamental interaction field may not rely on **independent external sectors** to define
or stabilise its conserved quantities or large-scale structure.

In particular:

- conserved charges must not be supplied by an independent matter sector;
- universal structural features must not depend on phenomenological functions or screening rules.

Logical status:  
Criterion D is a direct restatement of Axiom B. Any violation of Criterion D is a violation of
self-contained conservation.

---

## Consequences of the admissibility criteria

Taken together, Criteria C and D exclude from claims of fundamentality:

- gauge-type interaction fields whose conserved quantities depend on independent charge sectors;
- theories requiring interpolation, screening, or regime-dependent prescriptions;
- models retaining arbitrary functional freedom in highly symmetric settings.

These exclusions do **not** assert that such theories are false or empirically useless.
They assert only that such theories cannot qualify as **fundamental closing interaction fields**
under the definitions adopted here.

---

## Logical structure summary

The upstream framework consists of:

- **Axiom A:** Classical covariance  
- **Axiom B:** Self-contained conservation  

together with two **derived admissibility criteria**:

- **Criterion C:** Exhaustion under symmetry  
- **Criterion D:** No external sourcing of structure  

The separation between axioms and criteria prevents circularity. Gravity is not assumed to be
special; it is identified as special only after the eliminative classification is carried out.

---

## What the upstream framework does not assume

For clarity, the FFT does **not** assume:

- metric primacy;
- second-order field equations;
- a specific Lagrangian form;
- a fixed number of degrees of freedom;
- or universality of coupling.

All of these, if they appear, emerge only *downstream* of the classification.

---

## Transition

With the axioms and admissibility criteria fixed, the classification problem can now be addressed:

> Given a classical covariant interaction field satisfying Axioms A and B and admissibility
> Criteria C and D, which field structures are admissible in principle?

The next page applies this framework eliminatively to the major classes of classical fields.
