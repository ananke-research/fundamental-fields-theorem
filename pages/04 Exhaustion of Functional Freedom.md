# 04 — Exhaustion of Functional Freedom

This page isolates and emphasises the concept of **exhaustion under symmetry**, which plays a
central diagnostic role in the Fundamental Fields Theorem (FFT).

Although derived from closure rather than imposed as an axiom, exhaustion under symmetry is the
mechanism by which hidden external bookkeeping is detected and excluded.

## What exhaustion under symmetry means

A classical interaction field is said to **exhaust under symmetry** if, when sufficient spacetime
symmetry is imposed within a closure regime, all functional freedom in admissible solutions is
eliminated.

Only a **finite set of integration constants**, fixed by conservation laws and boundary conditions,
may remain.

In other words, once symmetry removes all physically distinct directions of variation, the field
equations must determine the solution space completely.

---

## Why exhaustion is required by closure

Closure requires that a field regulate its own conservation laws without appeal to external
prescriptions.

If, under sufficient symmetry, a theory still admits arbitrary functions in its solutions, then:

- the field equations alone do not determine admissible configurations;
- additional choices must be supplied by hand;
- conservation depends implicitly on external bookkeeping.

Such theories violate self-contained conservation, even if they are covariant and empirically
successful.

Exhaustion under symmetry is therefore not an aesthetic preference. It is a **structural necessity**
implied by closure.

## Exhaustion versus solvability

Exhaustion under symmetry is **not** a claim about mathematical solvability or integrability of the
full field equations.

A theory may:

- possess complicated dynamics in general settings,
- require numerical methods,
- or admit rich solution spaces in low-symmetry regimes,

and still exhaust under symmetry in its clean closure regimes.

Exhaustion concerns only those regimes in which conserved quantities are well defined and symmetry
is sufficient to remove functional freedom.

## Diagnostic power of exhaustion

Exhaustion under symmetry functions as a **diagnostic criterion**.

If a candidate fundamental interaction field:

- retains arbitrary functions in stationary, homogeneous, or isotropic settings; or
- requires phenomenological rules to select among symmetric solutions,

then it cannot be closed in the sense defined in the FFT.

This diagnostic is applied uniformly, without privileging gravity by assumption.

---

## Empirical motivation

The requirement of exhaustion under symmetry reflects established physics practice.

For example:

- vacuum gravitational exteriors are unique under symmetry;
- conserved charges in gravity are fixed by boundary conditions;
- no free functional data survive in stationary vacuum solutions.

These features are not imposed ad hoc. They are treated as signatures of a closed interaction.

The FFT elevates this empirical pattern to an explicit admissibility criterion.

---

## What exhaustion does *not* imply

Exhaustion under symmetry does **not** imply:

- absence of dynamical richness in general regimes;
- triviality of the theory;
- absence of non-vacuum structure;
- or lack of emergent behaviour in less symmetric settings.

It implies only that **fundamental interactions must close cleanly** where symmetry removes all
degrees of freedom that can meaningfully vary.

## Role within the FFT

Within the FFT, exhaustion under symmetry:

- detects hidden external bookkeeping;
- distinguishes closed from open interaction fields;
- explains the rigidity of vacuum gravity without assuming it;
- prepares the ground for eliminative classification.

The next page applies this diagnostic, together with the axioms of covariance and closure, to the
major classes of classical fields.
